You need to login to your spotify account to get visualisiation. Although it is also possible to start the app with demo mode by clicking on the "START demo mode" button.

## Current stage

At the moment the game is runable, but in an early prototype stage. Currently I am experimenting with different features, after I am done implementing them proper documentation will be added.
